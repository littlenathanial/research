Two types of trees can talk: normal trees and fat trees (do not trust the fat trees)

== Grass path ==
* She, the one who was never remembered.
* Do not trust the fat trees. - The fat trees are liars. Most of the time they tell you the opposite of truth.
* Be aware, the statue lives. - The statue at the bottom moves when you activate new sections of land.
* She was there when the world was young.
* We can talk but we can not see. - The trees can talk but they can't see what's going on.
* Are you proud? That you have found something that you should not?
* Do you really need to know who she is? Or what it is?
* You are not even close to the end. Give up. - This is not a lie. One of the decals created by Littlenathanial is named "The end is never the end". Meaning that there is no end.
* Do not listen to him, you have already gotten there.
* The thing walks with her - Just the title of the game
* The end is only where you determine it to be. - This may be true, however this contradicts "The end is never the end"

== Glass path ==
* The paths of life - The "paths of life" is something that is repeated a lot in some of Littlenathanial's places

== Stone path ==
* (Fat tree) What is the statue?
* She was here before. - Littlenathanial's mother was here before.
* (Fat tree) Where are you?

== Fall path ==
* Turn back while you can - The tree warns you of the danger in the Fall path.
* The fat trees - Not a complete sentence but we can deduce that the fat trees killed people.

== Meeting path ==
* Only the one can pass. - Only Littlenathanial can pass.

== Mystery path ==
* How did you get here?
* But you can not go on.

== City path ==
* Something in the night.
